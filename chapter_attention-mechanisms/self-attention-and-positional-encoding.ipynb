    "\n",
    "* In self-attention, the queries, keys, and values all come from the same place.\n",
    "* Both CNNs and self-attention enjoy parallel computation and self-attention has the shortest maximum path length. However, the quadratic computational complexity with respect to the sequence length makes self-attention prohibitively slow for very long sequences.\n",
    "* To use the sequence order information, we can inject absolute or relative positional information by adding positional encoding to the input representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose that we design a deep architecture to represent a sequence by stacking self-attention layers with positional encoding. What could be issues?\n",
    "1. Can you design a learnable positional encoding method?\n"
